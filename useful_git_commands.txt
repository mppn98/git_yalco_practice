#The most useful git commands

##Here there are some examples of git commands that I use often.

##Not all commands written here are git commands, but all of them are related to git. Please refer to the documentation for more details.

##Set your details
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email "john@example.com"
Use --global to set the configuration for all projects. If git config is used without --global and run inside a project directory, the settings are set for the specific project.

##Make git ignore file modes
cd project/
git config core.filemode false
This option is useful if the file permissions are not important to us, for example when we are on Windows.

##See your settings
git config --list

####Initialize a git repository for existing code
cd existing-project/
git init

##Clone a remote repository
git clone https://github.com/user/repository.git
This creates a new directory with the name of the repository.

##Clone a remote repository in the current directory
git clone https://github.com/user/repository.git .

##Get help for a specific git command
git help clone
U
##pdate and merge your current branch with a remote
cd repository/
git pull origin master
Where origin is the remote repository, and master the remote branch.
If you don't want to merge your changes, use git fetch

##View remote urls
git remote -v

##Change origin url
git remote set-url origin http//github.com/repo.git

##Add remote
git remote add remote-name https://github.com/user/repo.git

##See non-staged (non-added) changes to existing files
git diff
Note that this does not track new files.

##See staged, non-committed changes
git diff --cached

##See differences between local changes and master
git diff origin/master
Note that origin/master is one local branch, a shorthand for refs/remotes/origin/master, which is the full name of the remote-tracking branch.

##See differences between two commits
git diff COMMIT1_ID COMMIT2_ID

##See the files that changed between two commits
git diff --name-only COMMIT1_ID COMMIT2_ID

##See the files changed in a specific commit
git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r COMMIT_ID
or
git show --pretty="format:" --name-only COMMIT_ID
Source: http://stackoverflow.com/a/424142/1391963

##See diff before push
git diff --cached origin/master

##See diff with only the changed lines (no context)
git diff --unified=0

##See details (log message, text diff) of a commit
git show COMMIT_ID

##Count the number of commits
git rev-list HEAD --count
git rev-list COMMIT_ID --count

##Check the status of the working tree (current branch, changed files...)
git status

#Make some changes, commit them
git add changed_file.txt
git add folder-with-changed-files/
git commit -m "Committing changes"

#Rename/move and remove files
git rm removeme.txt tmp/crap.txt
git mv file_oldname.txt file_newname.txt
git commit -m "deleting 2 files, renaming 1"

##Change message of the last commit
git commit --amend -m "New commit message"

##Push local commits to remote branch
git push origin master
Push commits to all remotes, in a single command
Git does not do that, but see https://stackoverflow.com/a/18674313/1391963

##See recent commit history
git log
##See commit history for the last two commits
git log -2
##See commit history for the last two commits, with diff
git log -p -2
##See commit history printed in single lines
git log --pretty=oneline

##Revert one commit, push it
git revert dd61ab21
git push origin master

##Revert to the moment before one commit
reset the index to the desired tree
git reset 56e05fced

move the branch pointer back to the previous HEAD
git reset --soft HEAD@{1}
git commit -m "Revert to 56e05fced"

Update working copy to reflect the new commit
git reset --hard
Source: http://stackoverflow.com/q/1895059/1391963

##Undo the last commit, preserving local changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1
##Undo the last commit, without preserving local changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1
##Undo the last commit, preserving local changes in the index
git reset --mixed HEAD~1
Or git reset HEAD~1
See also http://stackoverflow.com/q/927358/1391963

##Undo non-pushed commits
git reset origin/master

#Reset to remote state
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
##See local branches
git branch
##See all branches
git branch -a
##Make some changes, create a patch
git diff > patch-issue-1.patch
##Add a file and create a patch
git add newfile
git diff --staged > patch-issue-2.patch
##Add a file, make some changes, and create a patch
git add newfile
git diff HEAD > patch-issue-2.patch

##Make a patch for a commit
git format-patch COMMIT_ID
##Make patches for the last two commits
git format-patch HEAD~2
##Make patches for all non-pushed commits
git format-patch origin/master
##Create patches that contain binary content
git format-patch --binary --full-index origin/master
##Apply a patch
git apply -v patch-name.patch
##Apply a patch created using format-patch
git am patch1.patch
##Break up multiple changes into separate commits (or commit only part of a changed file)
git add --patch file.txt
(press 'y' for the chunks to add)
git commit -m 'first part of the file'
(repeat if desired)

##Create a tag
git tag 7.x-1.3
##Push a tag
git push origin 7.x-1.3
##Create a branch
git checkout master
git branch new-branch-name
Here master is the starting point for the new branch. Note that with these 2 commands we don't move to the new branch, as we are still in master and we would need to run git checkout new-branch-name. The same can be achieved using one single command: git checkout -b new-branch-name

##Create a branch from a previous commit
git branch branchname sha1-of-commit
or using a symbolic reference (e.g. last commit):
git branch branchname HEAD~1
You can also use
git checkout -b branchname sha1-of-commit
Source: http://stackoverflow.com/a/2816728/1391963

##Check out a branch
git checkout new-branch-name
##See commit history for just the current branch
git cherry -v master
(master is the branch you want to compare)

##Merge branch commits
git checkout master
git merge branch-name
Here we are merging all commits of branch-name to master.

##Merge a branch without committing
git merge branch-name --no-commit --no-ff
##See differences between the current state and a branch
git diff branch-name
##See differences in a file, between the current state and a branch
git diff branch-name path/to/file
##Delete a branch
git branch -d new-branch-name
##Push the new branch
git push origin new-branch-name
##Get all branches
git fetch origin
##Get the git root directory
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
Source: http://stackoverflow.com/q/957928/1391963

##Remove from repository all locally deleted files
git rm $(git ls-files --deleted)
Source: http://stackoverflow.com/a/5147119/1391963

##Delete all untracked files
git clean -f
Including directories:
git clean -f -d
Preventing sudden cardiac arrest:
git clean -n -f -d
Source: http://stackoverflow.com/q/61212/1391963

##Delete all files from a git repository that have already been deleted from disk:
git ls-files --deleted -z | xargs -0 git rm

##Show total file size difference between two commits
Short answer: Git does not do that.
Long answer: See http://stackoverflow.com/a/10847242/1391963

##Unstage (undo add) files:
git reset HEAD file.txt

##See closest tag

Source: http://stackoverflow.com/q/1404796/1391963. See also git-describe.

##Debug SSH connection issues
GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -vvv" git clone <your_repository>

##Have git pull running every X seconds, with GNU Screen
screen
for((i=1;i<=10000;i+=1)); do sleep 30 && git pull; done
Use Ctrl+a Ctrl+d to detach the screen.

##See previous git commands executed
history | grep git
or
grep '^git'  /root/.bash_history

##See recently used branches (i.e. branches ordered by most recent commit)
git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate refs/heads/ | head

##Create a tar.xz file with all project files (excluding .git directory)
git archive --format tar HEAD | xz > project.tar.xz

##Git built-in alternative to the previous command
cd ..
tar cJf project.tar.xz project/ --exclude-vcs

##Create a tar with locally modified files
git diff --name-only | xargs tar -cf project.tar -T -

##Look for conflicts in your current files
grep -H -r "<<<" *
grep -H -r ">>>" *
grep -H -r '^=======$' *
There's also git-grep.

##Apply a patch not using git:
patch -p1 < file.patch
